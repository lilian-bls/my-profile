					<h1>Hello, I'm Lilian</h1>

					<h2>Rowing</h2>
						<p>
						I have been rowing for 2 years already! Before coming to ESSEC, I was at the ANUL (Aviron Union Nautique Lille) where I started to row. I rowed all the time and I passed my first FFA patent. However, I was not very good at it ... The reason? I'm too light to row in competition. Consequently, after my arrival at ESSEC, I directly registered with the CAE (Club Aviron ESSEC). But instead of continuing to row, I decided to start steering the boats. They needed a coxswain. Since then, I have been the official coxswain for the women's eight. And I started to bring back the gold medals with my team ! And so, our next destitnation is the French rowing championships!

					<h2>Foreign cultures</h2>
						<p>
						Frankly, who doesn't like foreign cultures? It's one of the best things that can exist! Learn new culture, new history, and new gastronomy !!!
